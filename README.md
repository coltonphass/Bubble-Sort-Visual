# 🫧 Bubble Sort Visualizer (C++)

This program shows a step-by-step visualization of the **Bubble Sort** algorithm directly in the console. It's great for learning how sorting works under the hood.

## 🔷 Features

- Sorts a predefined array of 20 integers
- Shows each pass through the array
- Displays comparisons and highlights swaps
- Outputs the final sorted result clearly

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the `.sln` (Visual Studio Solution) file in **Microsoft Visual Studio**
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` or click **Run** to execute the program

## 📌 Notes

- Uses basic `iostream`, `iomanip`, and `_getch()` for console control
- Educational focus — meant for understanding the logic, not performance
